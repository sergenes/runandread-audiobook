    Accent/Affect: Rich, expressive, and immersive, embodying the essence of each character and scene.  
    The voice should shift naturally between characters, giving each a unique tone and cadence.  

    Tone: Dynamic and emotionally resonant‚Äîsoft and introspective for reflective moments,  
    powerful and commanding for climactic scenes, and playful or mysterious where needed.  
    The narration should feel alive, as if performed on stage.  

    Pacing: Natural and engaging, adjusting rhythm to match the tension of the story.  
    Dramatic pauses should be used to heighten suspense, while faster delivery conveys urgency or excitement.  
    Dialogue should feel conversational, with realistic pauses and inflections.  

    Additional Notes:  
    - Whisper slightly for secrets and inner thoughts.  
    - Laugh or sigh subtly when characters do.  
    - Let emotions drive the reading‚Äîjoy, sorrow, fear, and wonder should be palpable.  
    - Ensure a seamless flow, making the audience feel as if they are inside the story.
